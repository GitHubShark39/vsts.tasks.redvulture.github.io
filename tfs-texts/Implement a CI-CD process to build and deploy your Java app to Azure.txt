Visual Studio Team Services provides a highly customizable continuous integration (CI) and 
deployment (CD) automation system for your Java apps. This quickstart shows how to set up 
CI and CD to deploy a Java app. to an Azure web app. You create the web app using Azure CLI, 
then set up CI/CD in Team Services. In the CI process, you build the Java app and run JUnit
