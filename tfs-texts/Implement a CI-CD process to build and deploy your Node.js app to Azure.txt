Visual Studio Team Services provides a highly customizable continuous integration (CI) and deployment 
(CD) automation system for your Node.js apps. This quickstart shows how to set up CI and CD to deploy a 
Node.js app to an Azure web app. You create the web app using Azure CLI, then set up CI/CD in Team Services. 

In the CI process, you use Gulp to run Mocha tests.
